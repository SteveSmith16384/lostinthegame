Lost in the Game is a trip through various ZX Spectrum games recreated in 3D.  You must complete each game in order to progress to the next one.  Each level is a relatively accurate recreation of the original game, with the same objectives.  Some knowledge of the original games is probably an advantage.

It's early in development with only a few games added, but plenty more are planned.

CONTROLS
* W, A, S and D - Move and strafe.
* Mouse to look around.
* F1 to toggle full-screen
