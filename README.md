## About the jam

<img src="screenshot_02.png" align="right" width="400px">

The Ludum Dare game jam (compo) is a 48h game jam. All code and assets must be created within this time by one person.
This means the code may be a bit messy some places! Jamming is very rewarding however, and I would strongly recommend it to everyone!
Ludum Dare 40 was my first attemt at creating a 3D game for a jam. 

### Tools used

- **Code:** LibGDX, IntelliJ
- **Graphics:** Paint.NET
- **Audio:** BOSCA CEOIL, BFXR/SFXR, Audacity
- **Timelapse:** Chronolapse
